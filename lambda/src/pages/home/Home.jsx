        I am a Computer Scientist who loves taking a hard problem, dissecting it, 
        understanding it, modeling it mathematically, and eventually coding robust, 
        automated solutions. I like to push the limits of what can be done with 
        technology, stretch it in new directions, and have fun.

        The aesthetics of this website are a tribute to the early days of Wikipedia, 
        the Semantic Web, and the <code>secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk</code> notes pages. 
        This style of design is minimalistic and direct, showing you don't need flashy 
        animations, hard to maintain libraries, or spinning backgrounds to make a 
        good website. Many old school programming forums still maintain this particular 
        style. It is less distracting and prioritizes utility.

        Check out my <a href="/projects" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a> and <a href="/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>. I've explored everything 
        from toy interpreters and scalable apps to implementations of methods from 
        academic papers. If you are here from my old website: a new puzzle is coming soon!
